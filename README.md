printed_lantern_shades
======================

These are various lantern shade designs I am making on my 3d printer for use in an outdoor LED lit project.

Not much to say.. these are various lantern shades I designed and printed on my 3d printer (a MakerBot Replicator) for use in various projects -- but mostly for the LED lighting project I have to replace the chinese lanterns with incandescent bulbs I use now.

The chinese lanterns are made of paper and after just a year, even taking them in for inclement weather, they start to fall apart.

I want to print lanterns that are slightly more durable and when I need a new lantern shade to replace one that has fallen apart all I need to is print it (instead of paying $10 for the white paper ones from some frou frou chain store.)
